    "Not great but it shows some of the basics, they do not explain formula and some of the code seems like it can be written in a simpler way  [example 2](https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter21.html), [example 3](http://yatani.jp/teaching/doku.php?id=hcistats:anova) from Yatani's website and another [example 4](https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter21.html). And in the next [link](http://web.pdx.edu/~newsomj/pa551/lecture8.htm) is explained the difference(there is not) between within subjects and paired samples studies. This [link](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/seminars/repeated-measures-analysis-with-r/) covers 4 different examples.\n",

    "[Non-parametric anova](https://github.com/mjskay/ARTool) This link goes to an R package that transforms continues values into ranks and then uses anova. The method is non-parametric and does not have many assumptions and it is claimed to be a better fit than friedman for repeated measures non-parameteric anova with 2 or more factors. The next is [another example](https://seriousstats.wordpress.com/tag/rank-transformation/) that covers rank transformation and then usage of lme instead of the friedman for ANOVA.\n",

    "4. Sphericity: This is the equivalent to the homoskedasticity but for within subjects designs. Here is a good explanation and code [link](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/sphericity-statistical-guide.php)\n",
